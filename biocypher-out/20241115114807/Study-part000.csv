'Within the scope of the TRACE-RICE project, this study performed at ITQB NOVA research institute (Portugal) aims to develop experimental and computational based methods to discriminate between 22 rice varieties, which are mostly commercialized within the Mediterranean region. With this purpose, genomic data was obtained from 20 samples of different rice varieties (originated from Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Pakistan and Egypt).'
